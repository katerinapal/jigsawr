SVG JIGSAW
==========

Damian Cugley, 14 August 2010

An experiment in making a jigsaw puzzle using SVG, images from the Internet, and JavaScript.

So far it takes a fixed image and divides it in to 16 tiles that can be
dragged around the arena. My drag & drop code is still defective, so if
you move the mouse fast enough to escape the tile, the drag stops
working properly.

My aim, if I can get this code working well enough before 25 August, is to enter
it in to the [10K Apart][] contest. I am working on this in odd hours of
spare time so I do not promise to finish it in time!
