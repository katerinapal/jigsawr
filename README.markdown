10K JIGSAW
==========

Damian Cugley, 12 August to 22 August 2010

Start at <http://jigsaw.alleged.org.uk/>, enter a Flickr tag and press the
Next to get button to one of Flickr’s most interesting photos with that
tag. Then press the Jigsaw button to see a jigsaw made from that
picture. The jigsaw pieces will snap together when you bring matching
pieces together, and you can then drag the hunks of puzzle around as you
work out where they belong in the finished picture. The trick is you
don’t know what it will look like until you finish the puzzle!

If you like, you can enter an image URL of your own. Animated GIFs will
work on some browsers, which is moderately amusing.

This game requires support for SVG and JavaScript in your web browser.
Tested in the latest Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, and Mozilla
Firefox. Testing in IE9 pending!

If you want to gaze upon the un-minified code, it is [available on
GitHub][1].

My aim, if I can get this code working well enough before 25 August, is
to enter it in to the [10K Apart][2] contest. I am working on this in odd
hours of spare time so I do not promise to finish it in time!
