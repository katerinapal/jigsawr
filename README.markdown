10K JIGSAW
==========

Damian Cugley, 12 August to 24 August 2010

Enter a Flickr tag and choose a difficulty level and the app creates you a jigsaw using
one of Flickr’s 25 most interesting photos with that tag (and compatible licence). The
jigsaw pieces will snap together when you bring matching pieces together, and you can
then drag the hunks of puzzle around as you work out where they belong in the finished
picture. The trick is you don’t know what it will look like until you finish the puzzle!

If you like, you can enter an image URL of your own. Animated GIFs will work on some
browsers, which is moderately amusing.

This game requires support for SVG and JavaScript in your web browser. Tested in the
latest Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet
Explorer 9 preview.

I have entered this app in the [10K Apart][2] contest. Visit it at
<http://10k.aneventapart.com/Entry/269>.

The competition page may not last forever, so you can also visit the app at
<http://jigsaw.alleged.org.uk/>.

If you want to gaze upon the un-minified code, it is [available on GitHub][1].
