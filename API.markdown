10K Jigsaw API
==============

You can add query parameters to the jigsaw URL to make it jump direct to a given image:

- `u`—URL of image;
- `t`—Flickr tags;
- `d`—difficulty, one of 1 (too easy), 9, 24, 60, 120 (too hard); and
- `j=1`—jump direct to jigsaw.

The first three correspond to items in the form, and the `j` parameter clicks the Jigsaw
button.
